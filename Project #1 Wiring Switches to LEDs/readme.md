# Project #1: Wiring Switches to LEDs


 In this project, you’ll get familiar with the build process by creating a simple
 FPGA design: when you press one of the push-button switches on your FPGA
 development board, one of the LEDs should light up. The project assumes
 that you have four switches and four LEDs, so you’ll design and program
 your FPGA to wire up each switch to one of the LEDs. (As mentioned
 earlier, you can adapt the project to use fewer switches and LEDs if needed.)
